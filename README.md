## Building
### Setting up your environment
Compiling this app requires [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org)'s devkitARM and libnds.
These can be installed by getting [devkitPro pacman](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman), then running:
`sudo dkp-pacman -S nds-dev`<br>
<sup>(command may be slightly different depending on your OS)</sup>

You will also need the [bmp2ds](https://github.com/Universal-Team/bmp2ds/releases/latest) graphics converter in your PATH named `bmp2ds`.

### Cloning the repo
To clone the repo run `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Universal-Team/pkmn-chest.git` (Note the `--recursive`, that is needed to clone the submodules)

If you already have the repo without the submodules you can run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to get the core submodule and the memecrypto submodule inside it.

### Compiling
Simply run `make` in the pkmn-chest source directory

## Contact
The best way to talk to us is to join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/KDJCfGF). If you want to report a bug or request a feature you can do so [in a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Universal-Team/pkmn-chest/issues/new/choose). You can also talk on the [GBAtemp thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-pkmn-chest-a-pokemon-bank-for-the-nintendo-ds-i.549249/).

## Translating
[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) is the preferred place for translating pkmn-chest as it manages keeping the languages synchronized and provides useful features when translating like screenshots for context. You can join the pkmn-chest project with [this invite link](https://crwd.in/pkmn-chest). If you don't want to use Crowdin you can send an updated `app.json` file on our Discord or the GBAtemp thread (linked above) or in an Issue here, direct Pull Requests editing the `app.json` files are not preferred since that messes with Crowdin's syncing.

If you'd like to help translate pkmn-chest to a language that isn't yet supported, or for a regional variant to be created for an existing language, please either [make a feature request issue](https://github.com/Universal-Team/pkmn-chest/issues/new/choose) requesting the language be added, ask on our Discord or the GBAtemp thread (linked above), or send Pk11 a message on Crowdin.
